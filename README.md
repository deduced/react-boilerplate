# react-boilerplate

Boilerplate for new React projects. Includes tooling and configurations.

## Why Would You Use This?

Primary use cases are:

- you want to build a project using modern, best practices;
- you want to maintain full control _while still keeping things simple_ without depending entirely on blackbox libraries, such as Create React App.

If you are just learning React, you should instead [follow React's recommendations](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) by using Create React App.

## Core Concepts

- Fully-configurable
- Based on Best Practices
- Linting rules are not overly strict
- Oriented towards use of hooks
- Accessibility-focused
- Babel-configuration to avoid verbose relative paths
